# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio! I have many projects listed here that I have recently worked on. Feel free to check it out by clicking 👉 [here](https://brian-walvoord.com)

I created this to showcase my work and share a little about me. This website was made using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. If you want to reach out to me or see more of my work, you can email me at brian.walvoord@gmail.com.

Cheers! 🍻
